A constructor in C++ is a special member function of a class that initializes objects of the class. It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type. Constructors are called automatically when an object of the class is created.

Types of Constructors
Default Constructor: A constructor that takes no arguments.

Parameterized Constructor: A constructor that takes arguments to initialize the object with specific values.

Copy Constructor: A constructor that initializes an object using another object of the same class.
