// OOP in C++ includes using classes and objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to create well-structured and reusable code. Understanding these principles is essential for effective software development in C++.

Class:> Class is a group of data member and methods it is a blueprint for creating object.

Object:> Object is an instance of a class. It is a definite representation of a class.


Encapsulation:>
Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping data and methods in a single unit. It is a way of protecting data from outside access

Inheritance:>
Inheritance is a mechanism of creating new classes from existing classes. It is a process of deriving new classes from existing classes. It is a way of reusing code from existing classes.

Polymorphism:>
Polymorphism is a mechanism of using a single name to refer to different types of objects. It is a method of using a single interface to refer to different types of objects.


Abstraction:> It is a mechanism of hiding the implementation details from the user. and showing only the functionality to the user.
