<!-- Event listeners are fundamental in creating interactive and dynamic web applications by allowing you to respond to user actions and other events. -->


<!-- An event listener in JavaScript is a function that waits for a specific event to occur on a particular element and executes a piece of code when that event is triggered. It allows you to respond to user interactions or other events in the web page, such as clicks, mouse movements, key presses, or form submissions. -->




Each event type provides specific functionality that you can handle in your JavaScript code to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

- `dblclick`: Fired when a mouse button is double-clicked on an element.
- `mousedown`: Fired when a mouse button is pressed down on an element.
- `mouseup`: Fired when a mouse button is released on an element.
- `mouseover`: Fired when the mouse pointer moves over an element.
- `mouseout`: Fired when the mouse pointer moves out of an element.
- `mousemove`: Fired when the mouse pointer moves while it is over an element.
- `contextmenu`: Fired when the right mouse button is clicked, usually to show a context menu.

=> 2. Keyboard Events

- `keydown`: Fired when a key is pressed down.

- `scroll`: Fired when the user scrolls the content of an element or the window.
